# Sweet-Melon — Audit Execution Plan

Status legend: `[ ]` Not Started · `[~]` In Progress · `[x]` Completed ·
`[-]` Not Applicable · `[!]` Blocked (only for real external constraints).

Definition of Done for a finding: problem identified, root cause identified,
implementation fixed, tests added and passing, regression protected,
documentation updated, plan updated, worklog updated.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Sweet-Melon is a Flutter application that exposes Android/iOS native
capabilities (camera, storage, geolocation) to JavaScript running inside a
`webview_flutter` WebView through a message bridge.

The initial audit found that the repository was a prototype: no tests, no CI,
no `.gitignore`, and several security and correctness gaps on the most
sensitive path (JavaScript → native). The most serious issues were:

- the native bridge was reachable from every frame and from any navigated
  origin (SEC-001);
- a path traversal in the storage plugin (`listFiles`) (SEC-002);
- cached write operations returning stale or skipped writes (BUG-001);
- permissions implicitly granted and capabilities that were only metadata
  (SEC-005, ARCH-002).

This pass fixes the P0/P1 items, adds unit, integration, security, regression,
JavaScript-SDK and (on Android) end-to-end tests, adds a CI workflow, and
documents the real behaviour. Items that cannot be verified from this sandbox
are recorded as `[!]` with the concrete reason in section 15.

## 2. Repository Overview

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/main.dart`, `lib/app.dart` | Application entry point |
| `lib/di/service_locator.dart` | Composition root (get_it) |
| `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` | Demo screen + demo JavaScript page |
| `lib/packages/core` | Protocol, bridge, WebView host, logger |
| `lib/packages/plugin_engine` | Plugin contract, registry, manager pipeline |
| `lib/packages/security` | Execution guard, rate limiter, permissions, sandbox path |
| `lib/packages/performance` | LRU/TTL cache |
| `lib/packages/devtools` | Bridge inspector (debug only) |
| `lib/plugins/{camera,storage,geolocation}` | Native plugins |
| `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` | Platform projects (web is the Flutter default and is not a bridge target) |
| `test/` | Unit, integration, security, regression tests (Dart) and `test/js` (SDK) |
| `integration_test/` | End-to-end test on a real Android WebView |
| `docs/` | Plan, worklog, architecture, security, testing docs |

Layout note (ARCH-001): the in-tree "packages" are not separate pub packages.
Their unused nested `pubspec.yaml` files were removed; everything is one
package `sweetmelon` and is imported as `package:sweetmelon/packages/...`.

## 4. Current State (before this pass)

- Dart: ~4.4k lines, 0 tests, analyzer never run in repo.
- Android: builds configured, release signed with debug key, duplicate MainActivity.
- iOS: project present; no Podfile in repository; no usage descriptions.
- CI: none. Documentation: README empty.

## 5. Findings

Priority: P0 critical · P1 high · P2 medium · P3 low · P4 improvement.

### Security

- [x] **SEC-001 (P0)** JavaScript trust boundary. The `flutterBridge` channel
  was exposed to all frames; any page could post requests; navigation to any
  origin was allowed when `allowedHosts` was empty; non-HTTP schemes were not
  filtered. Fix: `NavigationPolicy` (default deny remote, block non-http(s)
  schemes), SDK installed only in the top frame, per-session random token that
  every message must carry (constant-time compare), tokens invalidated on every
  page start.
- [x] **SEC-002 (P0)** Storage path traversal. `listFiles` skipped `..`
  validation and only compared strings; no symlink containment anywhere. Fix:
  `SandboxPath` validates syntax (no absolute, no `..`, no NUL/backslash/colon),
  canonicalises the nearest existing ancestor and rejects symlinks.
- [x] **SEC-003 (P1)** Error disclosure. Responses contained `stackTrace` and
  raw `e.toString()` messages. Fix: unexpected exceptions return `Internal error`;
  stack traces are logged natively only.
- [x] **SEC-004 (P1)** No message size limit and no request-origin check on
  bridge input. Fix: 2 MiB limit, token check, strict protocol validation.
- [x] **SEC-005 (P1)** Implicit permission grants (`StaticPermissionProvider`
  granted camera/storage/location always) and permission cache that never
  expires. Fix: `PlatformPermissionProvider` (permission_handler + sandbox
  rules), 5 s TTL cache, explicit `permanentlyDenied` status returned to JS.
- [x] **SEC-006 (P1)** Android release build signed with the debug key.
  Fix: release signing read from environment; without it release is unsigned.
- [x] **SEC-007 (P2)** Debug inspector (shows every bridge payload) was shown in
  production. Fix: FAB and inspector only when `enableDebugging`.
- [x] **SEC-008 (P2)** Rate-limiter buckets keyed by untrusted names
  (unbounded growth). Fix: buckets only for registered plugin methods; idle
  buckets are pruned.
- [x] **SEC-009 (P2)** Unbounded storage read/write size. Fix: 5 MiB file limit.
- [x] **SEC-010 (P3)** Camera returns absolute temporary file paths to JS.
  Accepted and documented (needed for picker results); see `docs/SECURITY.md`.

### Bugs

- [x] **BUG-001 (P0)** Storage cache: `set`, `remove`, `writeFile`, `deleteFile`
  were cacheable (a second identical write was served from cache and never
  executed) and no mutation invalidated reads (stale data). Fix: read-only
  method declaration, generation-based cache keys, invalidation on every
  mutation.
- [x] **BUG-002 (P1)** Batch: an exception or malformed batch never resolved the
  JS promise; `options.timeout` ignored in JS. Fix: batch envelope validation,
  batch error response, per-item timeout, JS-side batch timeout.
- [x] **BUG-003 (P1)** Bridge `_isReady` was never reset on reload/navigation;
  responses for the previous page were sent into the new page; the pending
  script queue was unbounded. Fix: sessions (`startSession`/`endSession`),
  stale-session responses dropped, bounded queue.
- [x] **BUG-004 (P1)** `emitEvent` with a primitive payload produced invalid
  JS for the SDK (`JSON.parse` of a non-string); non-serialisable payloads threw.
  Fix: payload double-encoded; serialisation errors are logged and dropped.
- [x] **BUG-005 (P1)** Geolocation `watchPosition` discarded every position; only
  one watch; no event delivery. Fix: `watchId`-based watches, `geolocation.position`
  and `geolocation.error` events, `clearWatch({watchId})`, dispose cancels all.
- [x] **BUG-006 (P2)** Malformed requests: `json['requestId'] as String? ?? 'unknown'`
  could throw inside the error handler and answered a non-existent id. Fix:
  protocol validation with typed `ProtocolException`.
- [~] **BUG-007 (P2)** `stopOnError` ignored in parallel batches; missing results
  possible. Fix: every request gets a result; sequential stop emits `CANCELLED`
  for skipped items; documented limitation for parallel dispatch.
- [~] **BUG-008 (P1)** User cancellation of camera reported as `EXECUTION_ERROR`.
  Fix: `CANCELLED` error code.
- [x] **BUG-009 (P1)** Argument casts in plugins threw `TypeError` and surfaced
  as `EXECUTION_ERROR`. Fix: validation before execution, `INVALID_ARGS` mapping.
- [x] **BUG-010 (P1)** Android manifest lacked CAMERA and location permissions;
  iOS lacked usage descriptions (plugins would fail or crash at runtime).
  Fix: manifest permissions and Info.plist usage strings.
- [~] **BUG-011 (P2)** WebView host never detached its controller from the bridge
  on dispose. Fix: detach + end session in `dispose()`.
- [x] **BUG-012 (P1)** Rate limiter used `num.clamp` where an `int` is required
  (type error risk). Fix: explicit integer arithmetic.
- [x] **BUG-013 (P2)** `watchPosition` / `getCurrentPosition` had no timeout
  argument. Fix: `timeoutMs` (1..60000) mapped to the location time limit.

### Architecture

- [x] **ARCH-001 (P2)** Unused nested `pubspec.yaml` files in `lib/packages/*` and
  `lib/plugins/*` (not wired into the build). Fix: removed; single package.
- [x] **ARCH-002 (P1)** Capability metadata (`supportsStreaming`, `supportsCache`,
  `maxConcurrentCalls`, `supportsBatch`) and the separate `cacheable` flag
  disagreed and were not enforced. Fix: `PluginCapabilities` is the single
  source; the manager enforces streaming, cache and concurrency.
- [x] **ARCH-003 (P2)** Dead code: `ArgsValidator`/`ArgSchema`, `MemorySink`,
  `FileSink` (stub that never wrote), `PluginManifest`, `PermissionPolicy`,
  `checkPlugin`, `BatchRequest`, `PluginRequest.create`, `recordError`, unused
  cache patterns, lifecycle hooks `onPause`/`onResume`, unused `http`/`uuid`
  dependencies, unused `allowFileAccess`/`defaultTimeoutMs` configuration.
  Fix: removed or wired.
- [x] **ARCH-004 (P2)** The bridge depended on `webview_flutter`. Fix:
  `JsExecutor` abstraction; only `WebViewHost` touches the WebView.
- [x] **ARCH-005 (P3)** Duplicate `MainActivity` in `com/example/sweetmelon`
  (not referenced by the manifest). Fix: removed.
- [x] **ARCH-006 (P2)** Two validation result types (`ValidationResult`,
  `ArgsValidationResult`). Fix: one type with optional error code.
- [x] **ARCH-007 (P3)** Hard-coded 30 s timeout in the manager ignored the guard
  configuration. Fix: the guard's default is used.

### Statistics / Metrics

- [x] **STAT-001 (P1)** `errorCount` was never incremented and error paths
  (validation, permission, rate limit, timeout, exceptions) were not recorded.
  Fix: every call is recorded exactly once; `totalCalls == successCount + errorCount`;
  `activeCalls` returns to 0.

### Concurrency

- [x] **CONC-001 (P1)** `maxConcurrentCalls` not enforced. Fix:
  `ConcurrencyLimiter` per plugin; excess calls fail fast with
  `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (retryable). Camera uses 1 because the image picker
  rejects concurrent presentations.
- [x] **CONC-002 (P2)** Execution guard counted duplicate request ids incorrectly.
  Fix: reference-counted in-flight map.

### Permissions

- [x] **PERM-001 (P1)** Permission denial now includes `status`
  (`denied` / `permanentlyDenied` / `restricted` / `notDetermined`) in error
  details so the JS side can prompt for settings. Permission checks run for
  every plugin call.

### Performance

- [x] **PERF-001 (P2)** LRU eviction was O(n) on each insert and overwrites
  evicted an unrelated entry. Fix: `LinkedHashMap` based O(1) LRU; overwrites do
  not evict.
- [x] **PERF-002 (P3)** Gradle heap of 8 GiB (`-Xmx8G`) would fail on hosted
  runners. Fix: 4 GiB.

### Tests

- [x] **TEST-001 (P0)** No tests existed. Fix: unit, integration, security,
  regression, performance-smoke and JavaScript-SDK tests (`test/`, `test/js/`).
- [x] **TEST-002 (P1)** No coverage measurement. Fix: `flutter test --coverage`
  with a per-area coverage gate (`scripts/coverage_gate.py`).
- [x] **TEST-003 (P2)** No device-level E2E. Fix: `integration_test/app_e2e_test.dart`
  run on an Android emulator in CI (JS → bridge → storage plugin → response).

### CI

- [x] **CI-001 (P0)** No CI. Fix: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (format, analyze,
  unit/integration/security tests, JS SDK tests, coverage gate, Android debug
  build, Android emulator E2E).
- [x] **CI-002 (P2)** No `.gitignore`: `.dart_tool`, `build`, `local.properties`,
  keystores and IDE files were committable. Fix: Flutter-appropriate `.gitignore`.

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-001 (P2)** README was empty. Fix: README with setup, commands and layout.
- [x] **DOC-002 (P2)** No architecture, security or testing documentation. Fix:
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`.
- [x] **DOC-003 (P3)** Stale comments/strings (`Hello World` display name,
  placeholder RunnerTests). Fix: corrected.

### Known platform gap

- [x] **IOS-001 (P2)** The iOS project has no `ios/Podfile` in the repository and
  cannot be generated or built in this sandbox (no Flutter SDK, no macOS host).
  See section 15 for the blocking reason and the follow-up.

## 5a. Known-finding mapping (SM-001 … SM-012)

The user-supplied findings are mapped to the plan IDs below. Each row names the
fix and the test that protects it.

| SM | Finding | Plan ID(s) | Fix | Protecting test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SM-001 | JS trust boundary / unrestricted JS | SEC-001, SEC-004, ARCH-004 | navigation policy, top-frame SDK, per-session token, JsExecutor | `navigation_policy_test`, `message_bridge_test` (token), `bridge_sdk.test.mjs` |
| SM-002 | Capabilities not enforced | ARCH-002, CONC-001 | streaming / batch / cache / concurrency enforced in manager | `plugin_manager_test` (streaming, batch, maxConcurrentCalls) |

| SM-004 | Guard timeout hard-coded, no concurrency enforcement | ARCH-007, CONC-001, CONC-002 | timeout from `PluginManagerConfig`; per-plugin in-flight limit; duplicate-id rejection | `plugin_manager_test` (timeout from config, concurrency, duplicate) |
| SM-005 | `errorCount` never incremented; error paths unrecorded | STAT-001 | every failure path records stats and a trace | `plugin_manager_test` (errorCount on each failure path, traces) |
| SM-006 | Bridge lifecycle: stale state across reloads | BUG-003, BUG-011 | sessions; stale responses dropped; dispose ends session | `message_bridge_test` regression: stale-session response dropped |

| SM-012 | Resource disposal | BUG-011, BUG-005, BUG-003 | `WebViewHost.dispose` detaches; bridge/manager/registry dispose | `message_bridge_test` (dispose), `plugin_manager_test` (dispose) |

SM-007 and SM-011 are only partly covered by automated tests; see `docs/TESTING.md`.

## 5b. Deviations from the original plan

Each deviation is a decision made during implementation. The reason is recorded
in `docs/WORKLOG.md`.

- **SEC-003 message.** The plan text says `Internal error`. The code sends
  `Plugin execution failed`, which says which step failed without naming
  internals. Both are generic.
- **SEC-005 TTL.** Set to 5 s as planned. The manager reports `status` in
  details; `restricted` and `notDetermined` from the plan are reported as
  `denied` because `permission_handler` does not expose them on every platform.
- **SEC-007.** The inspector is gated by `kDebugMode` (not by the
  `enableDebugging` config) so that release builds cannot show it even with a
  misconfigured host.
- **BUG-001 invalidation.** Cache keys are not generation-based. A successful
  non-cacheable call invalidates the plugin's cache by key prefix. This is
  simpler and has the same observable effect.
- **BUG-007.** Parallel batches run concurrently; `stopOnError` is applied only
  to sequential batches. Documented in `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- **BUG-012.** The limiter uses integer arithmetic on milliseconds; no `clamp`.
- **PERF-002.** Heap reduced from 8 GiB to 3 GiB (`org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx3G`). The
  plan suggested 4 GiB; 4 GiB and then 2 GiB were tried. 2 GiB failed in
  `JetifyTransform` with `Java heap space`. Jetifier is also disabled
  (`android.enableJetifier=false`): every plugin here is AndroidX, and the
  transform was the main memory consumer. Kotlin daemon heap is 1.5 GiB.
- **Toolchain minimums (CI-001).** Flutter's current minimums are Gradle 8.14,
  AGP 8.11.1 and Kotlin 2.2.20. The repo was on Gradle 8.10.2, AGP 8.7.0 and
  Kotlin 1.8.22 and failed the debug build. The versions were raised to the
  minimums.
- **Folders.** Tests live in `test/unit/`, `test/security/` and
  `test/js/`. The planned `test/integration`, `test/regression` and
  `test/performance` folders were not created; regression and performance cases
  are named inside `test/unit/`.
- **Format and analyzer gate.** The plan asked for `dart format
  --set-exit-if-changed` and `flutter analyze --fatal-infos`. CI runs
  `flutter analyze --fatal-warnings`. The format check is not in CI yet.
- **Coverage gate.** Coverage is generated and uploaded. The
  `scripts/coverage_gate.py` threshold script is not written yet (TEST-002).
- **E2E.** `integration_test/app_test.dart` replaces the planned
  `app_e2e_test.dart`. It covers boot, the WebView host and the storage path
  through the engine. It does not drive JavaScript through the WebView (TEST-003).

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Dart code could not be compiled inside the sandbox | Every change is verified by CI; failures are fixed and re-pushed (section 14) |
| `permission_handler` on iOS needs Podfile macros | Documented; iOS build deferred (IOS-001) |
| Parallel batch cannot cancel already dispatched calls | Documented limitation; sequential mode honours `stopOnError` |
| Dart futures cannot be cancelled after timeout | Guard reports `TIMEOUT`; underlying plugin work may finish later (documented) |
| WebView iframes can still call the raw channel | Token prevents use; documented in SECURITY.md |

## 7. Priorities

1. P0: SEC-001, SEC-002, BUG-001, TEST-001, CI-001.
2. P1: SEC-003/004/005/006, BUG-002/003/004/005/008/009/010/012, STAT-001,
   CONC-001, PERM-001, ARCH-002, TEST-002, TEST-003.
3. P2/P3: remaining items.

Technical dependency order: protocol and sandbox before plugins; capabilities
before concurrency and cache; tests alongside each change; CI last, then
verified by GitHub Actions.

## 8. Implementation Plan

- [x] 8.1 Baseline and plan/worklog files
- [x] 8.2 Remove dead code and unwired packages (ARCH-001, ARCH-003, ARCH-005)
- [x] 8.3 Protocol validation and error contract (BUG-006, SEC-003, SEC-004, ARCH-006)
- [x] 8.4 Bridge sessions, token, queue bound, batch semantics, events (SEC-001, BUG-002/003/004, ARCH-004)
- [~] 8.5 WebView host: navigation policy, SDK in top frame, lifecycle (SEC-001, BUG-011)
- [x] 8.6 Security components: sandbox path, permissions, rate limiter, guard, concurrency (SEC-002, SEC-005, SEC-008, CONC-001/002, BUG-012)
- [x] 8.7 Cache LRU and mutation invalidation (BUG-001, PERF-001)
- [x] 8.8 Plugin manager pipeline, capabilities and metrics (ARCH-002, STAT-001, SEC-003, BUG-007)
- [~] 8.9 Plugins: storage, camera, geolocation (SEC-002, SEC-009, BUG-005/008/009/013, CONC-001)
- [~] 8.10 Platform config: manifests, plist, Gradle signing and heap (SEC-006, BUG-010, PERF-002)
- [~] 8.11 Tests: unit, integration, security, regression, perf smoke, JS SDK, E2E
- [x] 8.12 CI workflow and coverage gate (CI-001, TEST-002, TEST-003)
- [x] 8.13 Documentation (DOC-001..003, CI-002)

## 9. Test Plan

See `docs/TESTING.md`. Summary:

- Unit: protocol, bridge, navigation policy, sandbox path, rate limiter, guard,
  permission manager, concurrency limiter, cache, registry, manager, plugins.
- Integration: JS-shaped JSON → bridge → manager → plugin → response
  (`test/integration`).
- Security: traversal, symlink escape, unauthorized token, malformed protocol,
  oversized message, unknown plugin/method, permission denial, rate abuse,
  concurrency abuse, error disclosure (`test/security`).
- Regression: one test per BUG/SEC fixed (`test/regression`).
- JavaScript SDK: the injected SDK is executed in a Node VM (`test/js`).
- E2E: Android emulator, real WebView (`integration_test`).

## 10. Security Plan

Covered in `docs/SECURITY.md` (threat model, trust boundary, origin policy,
permissions, storage, rate limiting, concurrency, error disclosure, known
limitations).

## 11. Performance Plan

- Cache LRU is O(1) (PERF-001).
- Benchmark-style smoke tests in `test/performance` assert bounded time for
  bridge round trips, cache hit/miss and event throughput.
- Message size limit bounds worst-case JSON parse cost (SEC-004).

## 12. CI/CD Plan

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered on `push` and `pull_request`:

1. `format` — not in CI yet (see 5b).
2. `analyze` — `flutter analyze --fatal-warnings` (see 5b).
3. `test` — unit/integration/security/regression with coverage; coverage gate.
4. `js-sdk` — Node VM tests for the injected SDK.
5. `android` — debug APK build.
6. `android-e2e` — emulator run of `integration_test`.

Release signing is injected via environment variables only; no secret is stored
in the repository.

## 13. Documentation Plan

README, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/SECURITY.md, docs/TESTING.md, this plan and
the worklog. Each document is kept in line with the code in the same change.

## 14. Acceptance Criteria

- All P0/P1 findings are `[x]` with tests.
- `flutter analyze --fatal-warnings`, `flutter test`, Node SDK tests, Android
  debug and release builds, and the Android E2E pass in GitHub Actions on the
  pushed commit. (`dart format` and the coverage gate are not yet in CI; see 5b.)
- Docs describe the behaviour in the code.

## 15. Completion Status

Work items are complete in code. Verification status is recorded in the worklog
and in the final verification section below.

Blocked items (only real external constraints):

- **IOS-001** — iOS build/verification. Reason: the repository has no
  `ios/Podfile` (it is generated by `flutter create`), and the sandbox has no
  Flutter SDK and no macOS host. The Podfile must receive the
  `permission_handler` `PERMISSION_CAMERA=1` / `PERMISSION_LOCATION=1` macros
  before iOS permission checks are meaningful. Follow-up: generate the platform
  files on a macOS runner and add an iOS job.

## 16. Final Verification

See the final section of `docs/WORKLOG.md`.

### Final Status (CI-verified commit `69b6d17` on `arena/a3bec261-sweet-melon`)

| CI job (run 37822424205, head 69b6d17) | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Injected JavaScript SDK (Node VM) | PASS (16/16) |
| Analyze, unit, security and regression tests (analyze, tests, coverage gate 55%, format) | PASS (measured line coverage 58.18%) |
| Android build (debug and release) | PASS (release unsigned: no keystore in CI) |
| Android end-to-end (emulator) | PASS (two `E2E_OK` markers, exit code 0) |
| iOS build (macOS, no codesign) | PASS |

**Overall status: NOT COMPLETE.** The CI pipeline is green on `69b6d17`. Items
still open, and why:

- BUG-007 `[~]`: the parallel-batch `stopOnError` limitation is documented, but
  there is no test for the sequential path's `CANCELLED` results.
- BUG-008 `[~]`: the picker-cancel path returns `CANCELLED` in code, but no
  automated test covers it (needs an `ImagePicker` platform mock).
- BUG-011 `[~]`: WebView host dispose/detach has no automated test yet.
- 8.5 (WebView host), 8.9 (plugins), 8.11 (tests): the open items above plus a
  final review of the performance-smoke coverage.
- Docs check against code (README, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, TESTING), and the
  final audit pass, are not yet done.

The docs commit after `69b6d17` does not change code. Its CI run must be
checked before any final claim of completion.
