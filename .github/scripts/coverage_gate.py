"""Enforce a minimum line-coverage threshold from an lcov file.

Usage: coverage_gate.py coverage/lcov.info THRESHOLD_PERCENT [EXCLUDE_REGEX]

Counts lines (LF/LH records) across all source files, optionally skipping
files whose path matches EXCLUDE_REGEX. Prints a summary and exits 1 when the
percentage is below the threshold. Generated and platform-only code is
excluded in the workflow, not here.
